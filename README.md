# Deadlock - Vietnamese Localization

This repository contains an ongoing Vietnamese translation for [Deadlock](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450), a game currently in development by [Valve](https://valvesoftware.com/). This project aims to provide a Vietnamese language option for players who wish to experience the game in their native language.

## Current Status
A basic translation has been completed, allowing players to enjoy the game in Vietnamese. However, there may be some errors or unnatural phrasing. We will continue to update the translation regularly.
